Yeah, so I managed to do this script for Discord Virtual Fisher Bot. This is done in educational purposes only and everything you do with this is on you.

So this script is done by me - Juzu01 and it has multi-function things to offer!

- Fisher is currently in POLISH language ONLY!
  
- "Ustaw Obszar" - it is an option to set a border of space where the program will be searching for upcomming CAPTCHA.
To use it you have to click on button and then drag cursor on the left bottom in the discord chat, and then after notification click (OK) and do it again but now hold in a one position too but in the right top corner of chat.
(That will make a square of space where the captcha can be found).

- "Ustaw Miejsce do Pisania" - it is an option to set a place where your mouse will be automaticly clicking while doing it's work. So basically you have to click on Button, and then hold it for some seconds in the middle of stripe where you click to type on chat.

- "Ilość rozwiązanych CAPTCHA" - amount of solved CAPTCHAs
- "Status" - status of bot [ working ] or [ not working ]
- "Start" - button starting a program AFTER setting "Ustaw Obszar" and "Ustaw Miejsce do Pisania"
- "Stop" - Stop working

It is probably all. You can also turn on program and shut it down using 
"-" to shut down
"*" to turn on

Have fun and enjoy!
